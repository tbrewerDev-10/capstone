### Introduction
If you were in New York City and you needed a ride to or from work or from one borough to another, what would you take to get there?

Before 2011, that was an easy question to answer.
    Taxis
    
But now, that answer for most people has changed.
Ever since the launch of Uber and other For Hire Vehicles in New York City, the Taxi industry has suffered major losses.
Although they are still around today, their numbers are not anywhere near what they used to be.
So we decided to see how big of an impact For Hire Vehicles truly had on the Taxi industry and what other factors could be affecting those numbers as well.
